# Assignment 1
## GPS Spoofing Detection with Parallel Computing

Goal:
Analyze vessel tracking data from AIS records using parallel processing techniques to detect GPS spoofing events. Students will focus on efficient data handling, transformation, and performance evaluation using Python's parallel computing capabilities.

## Dataset: 25.08.2024
http://web.ais.dk/aisdata/  

## Submission and Presentation
* Deadline: All tasks (1-4) must be completed and submitted by the specified end date and time.
* Presentation Format: Up to 5 slides covering solutions to tasks 1-4.
* Requirement: Students must submit their code to a specified code repository (GitHub, GitLab).

### Evaluation Criteria

* Category -> Description
* Code Quality -> Clarity, efficiency, and correctness of the implementation.
* GPS Spoofing Detection ->	Accuracy and effectiveness in detecting spoofing events.
* Performance Analysis -> Depth of parallel processing efficiency evaluation, speedup calculations, and visualization of results.
* Use of Vilnius University HPC (+1 Point)	-> Proper execution and documentation of results on the HPC system.
* Presentation ->	Clarity and conciseness in explaining the solution.


# 1. Parallel Splitting of the Task
Objective: Strategize the division of AIS data processing into parallelizable sub-tasks.

Guidance: Discuss different parallel computing techniques, such as data parallelism or task parallelism. Ensure workload balancing among parallel tasks.
